StoryTeller
===========
A story telling addon for World of Warcraft.

This addon is designed to tell long stories for roleplaying, including emotes and macros.

How to use
----------
Type `/story` to open the main window then paste your text in the edit box.

Click the **Read** button to read the selected line and jump to the next one.

You can navigate through the text lines using the buttons **<<** and **>>**.

To start over with a new text, click **Clear** to reset then paste a new text.

Tips and tricks
----------------
* The text can contain emotes and macros as long as you don't use protected functions.
* You can't edit the text directly in the window, you have to do it in a separate text editor.
* Blank lines and lines that starts with a comment code `--`, `//` or `#` are ignored.
* Text lines are sent using the chat window. Add a `/s` or `/party` to the first line to be sure to send the text to the right place.
